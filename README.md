The goal of this development project is to create a Scrabble game using the Python programming language, 
following the rules and mechanics set out in the Wikipedia article on the game of Scrabble. The resulting 
game will allow users to play Scrabble games in a console interface, with functionality for the board, tiles, 
scoring and word validation.
